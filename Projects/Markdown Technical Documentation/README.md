## üë• User Stories
In order for the project to be acepted, it had to fullfil the following user stories:

1. There is a main element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
2. Within the `#main-doc` element, there are several section elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five.
3. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
4. Each section element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`).
5. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each).
6. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each).
7. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each).
8. There is a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.
9. The `navbar` element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
10. The navbar should contain link `a` elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.
11. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link `a` elements in the navbar.
12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
13. When you click on a `navbar` element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header).
14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
15. The technical documentation should use at least one media query.
