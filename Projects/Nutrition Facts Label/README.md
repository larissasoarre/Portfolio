# Nutrition Facts Label
This is a simple  nutrition label built with HTML and CSS as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum for the Responsive Web Design Certification. The goal was to practice using typography to style text and adjust line heights to make it easy to read and suit its purpose. After completing the requirements of the project,  I added a personal touch to make the webpage more appealing and better aligned with my style.


## ‚ú® Features
The nutrition label includes the following features:

* A clean design with a white background, black text, and minimal use of color. The font family used is 'Open Sans' and the label has a box-shadow effect to add depth.
* Includes a breakdown of the nutritional information for the product, including the serving size, calories, and daily values for various nutrients.
* Follows the most updated requirements from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
