                <h2>Library Messias</h2>
                <p>Library Messias was a project initiated by <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/">Palo Alto
                        Networks</a> following our successful completion of
                    a mentorship program focused on user interface and data security. They approached my team and me
                    with a challenging yet compelling idea: to spearhead the digitalization of small businesses by
                    developing a comprehensive interface for their entire management system.</p>

                <p>Given the tight deadline of only 3 weeks, my team and I had to collaborate closely and employ agile
                    methodologies such as SCRUM and design sprints to efficiently manage all project tasks. Within my
                    team, I worked alongside skilled individuals specializing in data management and development to
                    ensure our prototype aligned seamlessly with the software's requirements.</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Library Messias is a charming bookshop nestled in the vibrant Greater São Paulo Area of Brazil. Their
                    extensive collection features a wide range of brand new books spanning various genres, catering to
                    diverse reading preferences. Additionally, recognizing that some customers may prefer temporary
                    ownership, Messias provide the option to rent books for a specified duration.</p>

                <p>Should a desired book be temporarily unavailable, they offer a convenient waiting list service. By
                    joining this list, customers will be promptly notified when the book becomes available, ensuring
                    they
                    never miss out on their literary pursuits.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Library Messias faced difficulties in managing their business processes due to the lack of
                    digitalization. To address this challenge, the main goal was to design a modern software solution
                    that
                    would enable all librarians to effectively handle key tasks such as inventory management and book
                    rental
                    management. This software would be developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and implemented in
                    subsequent stages of development to ensure a gradual and successful rollout.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>My team and I commenced the project by diligently identifying the specific challenges the library
                        was
                        facing and determining how our interface could effectively address them. With a clear
                        understanding
                        of the problems at hand, I proceeded to map out the software architecture, laying the foundation
                        for
                        its development.</p>

            <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>To kickstart the creative process, I began by crafting basic wireframes with low fidelity. These rough
                wireframes helped me visualize and refine the information architecture of each page, allowing for a
                clear and organized structure.</p>

            <h2>High Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
            <p>I added fidelity to wireframes with imagery, colours, and fonts. The software needed to have a modern and
                minimalist appearance. Additionally, it was crucial for the design to be simple and intuitive, ensuring
                an easier digitalization process for the company's librarians.</p>

                librarians and set the stage for efficient digital operations.</p>
